# Barcelona
My first dive into the world of data science! I play around with a large Barcelona data set that contains information regarding:
  
  * Births
  * Deaths
  * Population
  * Unemployment
  * Immigrants by Nationality
  * Immigrants by Age
  * Immigrats and Emmigrants by Age 
  * Immigrants and Emmigrants Sex
  * Most frequent baby names
  * Most frequent names
  * Life expectancy
  * Accidents
  * Air quality measurements 
  * Bus stops and other public transports
  
  
# Population Analysis
  
This first graph depicts the total population count per year.
  
Quite obviously, the population within Barcelona is increasing.. quite quickly as well.
